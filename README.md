# Blog--WebAPP
A simple and elegant blog web application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS. This project allows users to create, view, edit, and delete posts in a clean, responsive interface inspired by Paul Graham's essays page. No database is used; post data is managed within the application's memory for the current session.
